        "**Vicheda**, child, means 'cutting apart' or 'separation.' It is the illusion that the material world and spiritual realm are different things. When a community falls into Vicheda, the sacred loses its power to nourish the mundane, and the mundane loses its ability to express the sacred.
        
        **The Banyan's Role**: Your village Banyan is what we call a **Sthanu**‚Äîa pillar between worlds. It channels cosmic energy into earthly form. When the community separates spirit from matter in their thinking, the Sthanu can no longer bridge the gap effectively.
        
        **The True Solution**: Healing requires **Yoga**‚Äînot just the physical practice, but its deeper meaning: 'to yoke' or 'to unite.' The village must remember that every action can be sacred, every sacred practice must touch daily life."
        
        He hands you a small scroll: "This contains a meditation practice for **Aikya**‚Äîunity consciousness. But remember, true understanding comes not from reading, but from living the teaching."`,
